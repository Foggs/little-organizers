As a child, I found great comfort in things being orderly so I often found myself organizing every room, drawer, cabinet, and closet &ndash;<span>not only my house but my friends' houses also</span>!<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>

                    <p>
                        When things feel out of control, we often don’t know where to begin. I love to put things in sections and match them with other common items, while also arranging items in height order or color coded. To me, things not only have to look pretty once they are sorted, they also need to make sense and therefore make life easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also love to tackle big projects that most people find intimidating, such as the garage, shed, attic and basement. It gives me great pleasure to sort through everything and create order out of chaos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although I have a love for organizing I did not choose that as my career path out of high school. I decided to pursue a degree in Accounting and soon found myself with a high-paced job at a Manhattan firm. I started at the bottom and, through hard work and dedication, I climbed my way up the corporate ladder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But even with a busy a career and a young family, I continued to organize houses, apartments, dorm rooms and offices on the side. I did this because it made me happy. Eventually, I decided to turn in my briefcase and pursue my dream of becoming an entrepreneur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result is Little Organizers, a small business dedicated to helping clients organize their lives in a way that not only makes sense but is also easy to use and simple to maintain.

This includes coffee mugs located near the coffee pot, decluttered countertops, and a beautifully designed pantry. My job is to make doing everyday tasks from preparing and cooking a meal to emptying the dishwasher simple and easy. We could all use a little extra time in our day and a decluttered, well-organized kitchen will ensure that you make the most of your space while being efficient and effective. </p>

Anyone with little kids knows how challenging it can be to keep their spaces organized in a way that is easy for kids to use, and a breeze to clean up. Just when you get a handle on it, a birthday or holiday comes along and you find yourself right back to where you started. I can create a system for all the toys, games and books that is functional, tidy and appealing. Most importantly, the system will be easy to maintain so that your child will finally be able to put their toys away themselves, fostering an enhanced sense of independence and the pride that comes with that. We can work in the framework of shelving and bins that you already have or I can purchase and assemble needed items. Additionally, I can help you sort through the toys and discard, donate or sell any unwanted or outgrown items..</p>

                                <p class="hidden">The key to a well put together bedroom is an expertly organized closet. When it comes to closets, I just love to make the best use of the space you have. I like to make color-coded sections in the closet and separate work, dress and casual clothing, all on matching hangers. An important rule for closet organization is visibility. I believe if you can’t see something, you will rip your closet apart looking for it. That’s why I like to organize sweaters, scarves, belts, wallets, purses, and shoes in clear bins. Another great joy of mine is to organize drawers, with separate compartments for socks and undergarments. It not only makes putting your clothes away easier but also makes finding them a piece of cake. Additionally, I can assist you in editing your wardrobe to discard, donate or sell unwanted and outdated items. I can also clear off all the clutter on top of the dressers and make everything look beautiful and orderly.</p>

                                <p class="hidden">This is typically the dumping ground for many items that we either use infrequently/seasonally or not at all. Worse than that, they are usually not stored or protected properly. I absolutely love to tackle these huge projects. I take every single item and separate it into categories, and then either with the purchase of bins or using what you have, I protect and pack the items and store them in categories. If there is a need for shelving I not only make the purchase, but I assemble and install them as well. How nice will it be to go into these areas and easily find what you are looking for? Also, protection is key in these areas as they tend to be most susceptible to climate, rodents, and possible leaks. It’s not a pleasant experience when your pipe bursts and photographs that were not protected properly are damaged and priceless memories are lost. On a more positive note, I have had clients discover things that they didn’t even know they had -- everything from an extra coffee pot to lost photographs to forgotten money. There could be so many treasures just waiting to be found and sometimes the discovery of lost items ends up paying for the services themselves.</p>

How many of us have a garage so poorly organized that we have room for pretty much everything except the car! I like to clear the entire garage out if possible and categorize all items in piles outside on the property. At this point, we will also identify items that can be discarded, donated or sold. Next, I give the empty garage a good sweep and purchase and assemble any shelving required. I then pack everything up using labeled bins if necessary and find the perfect spot for each bin. Care is given to create a system that is easy to follow, saves space and offers the protection that comes from proper storage. After everything is said and done, you will have a space that functions both as a storage space AND as a garage for your car. That’s right… you really can have it all!</p>

By creating a streamlined and efficient space, you will spend more time servicing your customers and less time apologizing for things that slipped between the cracks, files that went missing, bills that went unpaid, or invoices that weren’t generated. Every office is only as efficient as its system. Creating the perfect paper flow and filing system customized to your needs is key to success. I also organize the cabinets, desks, and reception areas so that they are welcoming and user-friendly. Clients get their first impression of your business by the very sight of what they see upon entering the building. It’s important to have an aesthetically pleasing entrance. It is also fair to say that employees are much happier and work better in an organized environment.</p>

                                <p class="hidden">Whether you are downsizing or upgrading, I can assist in preparing for a move of any kind. There are several reasons it is important to properly prepare for a move. Not only can it save you money on the actual move itself, but it can also make unpacking a much simpler process. No matter how much we may look forward to moving to a new home, the stress that surrounds packing is undeniable because the task can seem so daunting and intimidating. But preparing for your upcoming move can also offer you an opportunity to organize your belongings like never before. We can go through everything and identify what items are not worth taking or that you no longer want or need and either discard, donate or sell them before the move therefore saving you money with the moving company and potentially making a bit of money to offset some of the moving costs. All items that are worthy for the move will be packed safely and in clearly marked boxes designated for each room of the new house and making the unpacking process much easier. It is also nice to pack “immediate use” boxes so that the important items you need for that day (such as sheets and toiletries) will be clearly marked and prioritized. Don’t just pack -- pack in an organized fashion!

Most of us have very busy lives and unpacking can be extremely stressful. We’ve all been there. I can unpack either every single box or just a few essentials to get you started. This can be done together with you by my side or alone while you are at work. Just think how amazing it would be to come home from work to a house that is beautifully organized with beds made, clothes in closets and dressers, and toiletries in the medicine cabinet! Additionally, I consolidate all boxes and packing material for curbside pickup, leaving you with absolutely no mess!

                                <p class="hidden">An aesthetically pleasing, organized, fully functional house will sell faster than a cluttered home. All the rooms of the house must be decluttered and staged to catch the eye of the buyer. The buyer needs to look at the space and be able to envision themselves there. They won’t be able to do this if they can’t see your countertops. Not only that, a room can appear smaller when it isn’t organized well or has too much stuff filling the square footage. Some sellers may find themselves in a rush to sell due to a death or divorce so let me help you speed up the process with my organizing skills.

                                <p class="hidden">Whether it be finishing the basement, redesigning the kitchen or gutting the entire home I can help make this process less complicated. We can take this opportunity to go through all items and see what we can discard, donate or sell and then take the items that we decide to keep and pack them properly in marked boxes and move them either in a pod or another area of the house. Attention will be paid to make sure your items are stored in a way that will protect them from the inevitable dust and debris that comes with renovations. After the construction has taken place I can come back and help you unpack all boxes, consolidate the boxes and packing materials for curbside pickup and put all items away in an organized fashion. Having a clear space to work in will allow your contractor to complete the project more quickly and can help keep the crew on schedule. This will also give you more time to spend overseeing the work, and picking out all your new items for the project.

                        Many clients feel embarrassed by the projects that need re-organizing in their lives. I tell them all the same thing: We have all been there. I enter every space I work in with zero judgement.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes we feel sentimental and have a hard time making changes. It’s normal to hang onto things longer than we need them. Sometimes we have things we want to donate, but the research or effort involved keeps letting that priority slip down our To Do list. Life moves at a crazy pace and many of us are juggling more than ever before.
